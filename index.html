                    <p>My favorite memory of him is hard. There's a lot. His sr great Year lax season and how he handled a tough loss after a crazy good season. Nonchalantly winning the Connecticut state chess championship, crushing my client's kid who threw a hissy fit. Driving with him to test out the route to Cameron in Houston before his first day of work. Correcting the guide at the museum of natural history who misidentified a diplodocus. Playing with Zoe, which he wont recall, he was too young. Maybe watching the history channel w him at a motel in bar harbor—Doubt he remembers, mattered a lot to his life. I will work on it.</p>

                    <h3>Favorite thing about Jack</h3>
                    <p>Jack has a deep commitment to his friends, and I am honored to call him one of my best friends. The connection is beyond a fun friend, he is someone who inspires me, and is there for me in tough times. He is someone I can trust with my life and I would walk through walls for him, as I know he would do for me.</p>

                    <p>Favorite memory is tough because there are just so many that have us lying on the floor laughing. But I think this encapsulates Jack. At five years old, he confidently walked away with the head of admissions at Trinity, explaining to her how he was going to be a paleontologist for Halloween and wondering what she was going to be.</p>
                    <h3>Favorite thing about Jack</h3>
                    <p>I love that Jack is uniquely self-aware and oblivious. He honors his true self, 'leaning into his weirdness' as he once put it. He has somehow managed to thread the needle, so this reads as charming and "just Jack" and we love him for it. Personally, I adore that he is always game for an adventure or excursion outside of his comfort zone. This is us on the top of Angels Landing, Zion National Park.</p>

                    <p>Jack is an incredibly intelligent person who is purposeful in everything that he does including being your friend. Goes out of the way to spend time and catch up with you and when you're with him you know it matters a lot to him. He's made me think about things I didn't know exist all while demonstrating he'd be there through thick and thin.</p>

                    <p>My favorite memory with Jack is our tex mex dinner in Austin where we talked about our developing life philosophies for probably three hours over the best dinner we'd ever had (fish al Diablo at a restaurant I'm sure Jack remembers the name of). This was one of maybe a hundred long life chats we've had over the years that serve as snapshots of who we were at given times in our lives, chats that have helped made me who I am today.</p>
                    <h3>Favorite thing about Jack</h3>
                    <p>I love that Jack is uniquely himself, in all his glory and weirdness. He knows who he is and what he believes in and he lives his values day in day out.<br><br>And I love that when Jack asks how you are he really cares, he doesn't want surface level stuff, he wants to dig into what's happening in your life, to share in your successes and your struggles with you.</p>

                    <p>He's a very unique guy that isn't afraid of going against the mainstream or standing out. He has a lot of well-researched and strongly held opinions, which he often takes too far. Photo evidence showing him taking his Huberman/mindfulness/health beliefs too far in public (eventually leading to his inability to walk last year)</p>

                    <p>In the 5th grade we used to build exploding pens and highlighters together. Jack figured out you could take the spring out and put it back in the wrong order so that when you press the top the pen shoots open and the parts fly everywhere. The highlighters had an even bigger/stronger spring. I think Jack figured this out when we were bored in Hebrew school. We then turned it into a mini business and sold a few of the exploding highlighters for $5 until they got banned by teachers because people were shooting pens across the classroom</p>
